# Purely Functional Data Structures in JS

After reading Chris Okasaki's *[Purely Functional Data Structures][]*, I decided I
was crazy enough to port some of the structures from the book to JavaScript
(ECMAScript).

Each structure is in its own module/file, and you will need an AMD loader such
as [RequireJS][] to use them.
